                    During the review process, we will provide detailed feedback on the following aspects:
                    <br />
                    1. Formatting and Layout: We will examine the organization of your resume, including the use of
                    headings, bullet points, and overall visual appeal. Our goal is to ensure that your resume is
                    visually pleasing and easy to navigate.
                    <br />

                    professional and polished.
                    <br />
                    3. Keyword Optimization: We'll ensure that your resume is optimized with relevant keywords and
                    industry-specific terminology, which can enhance its visibility to applicant tracking systems (ATS)
                    used by employers.

                    4. Targeted Audience: If you provide information about the job or industry you are targeting, we

                    suggestions on how to enhance your resume. We'll offer guidance on improving weak sections,
                    emphasizing key accomplishments, and maximizing the impact of your qualifications.
                    <br />
                    6. Upon completion of the review, you will receive a comprehensive report outlining our
                    observations,
                    suggestions, and recommended changes. This report will serve as a valuable resource for you to
